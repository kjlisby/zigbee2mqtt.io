## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the light bulb ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zkpZSv84H4)).


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../configuration/device_specific_configuration.md)*


* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possbile with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "-"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
